# drums_database_creation
This is a fictional database about drums. It was made as a little project to demonstrate what I learned from the course “Fundamentos de Bases de datos” at Platzi.

All the data here presented was taken mixing information from the internet when I researched about drums and instruments stores around 5 countries. If any data coincide with real and delicate information about anything or anyone is just coincidence.

## Defining the entities and attributes

The data will be about drums, some of the information will contain data for types of drums, weigh, brands, location, pieces that conform the drums, distributors, materials and addresses. I defined just four entities: “baterías”, “piezas”, “marcas” and “distribuidores” .

Entity “baterias”:

Entity “distribuidores”:

## Relations

Now I create the relations between the tables, after I assign the cardinality to have a better understanding and clearness of the database.

## Entity Relation Diagram (ERD)

Now that I have more clarity about the data lets see the ERD of the database. This is just the first model of the database.

Now this is the final diagram of the database created :point_right: : [ERD](drums_ERD.png)
